# ncbt

Brainfuck is a Turing-complete (http://www.iwriteiam.nl/Ha_bf_Turing.html) programming language created by Urban Muller, and one that I'm assuming no one ever really asked for. It's a neat little language; what's more, it's thoroughly easy to compile or translate from BF. 

Accordingly, <b>ncbt</b>, the *Needlessly Complex Brainfuck Compiler* has been written using modern compiler-generation tools (Flex and Bison) and an object-oriented approach in c++. 

*inb4* I could have implemented such a translator/compiler with significantly less code, in less time, more efficiently. Remember, it's the <b>ncbt</b>, not the *Multi-threaded Hundred-byte LLVM One-up That Finds New Primes And Also Happend To Be A Brainfuck Translater*. The, err, <b>mhlofnphbt</b>, or something equivalent.

Enjoy!
